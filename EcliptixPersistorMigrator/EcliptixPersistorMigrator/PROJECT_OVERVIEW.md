# EcliptixPersistorMigrator - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Mission

Transform monolithic database scripts into a maintainable, modular, enterprise-ready database schema management system for the EcliptixMemberships platform.

## 📊 Project Statistics

### Before Restructuring
- **4 monolithic SQL files** (Scripts/01-04)
- **Mixed concerns** in single files
- **Difficult maintenance** and debugging
- **No clear deployment strategy**
- **Limited reusability** of components

### After Restructuring  
- **36 modular SQL files** organized by domain
- **10 tables** across 5 logical domains
- **3 functions** for data access patterns
- **14 procedures** for business logic
- **9 triggers** for automatic behaviors
- **5 deployment scripts** for orchestrated deployment
- **3 utility scripts** for maintenance

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### Domain Organization
```
EcliptixMemberships/
├── Core Domain (Foundation)
│   ├── AppDevices - Device management
│   └── PhoneNumbers - Phone number registry
├── Relationship Domain
│   └── PhoneNumberDevices - Many-to-many relationships
├── Verification Domain (OTP Workflows)
│   ├── VerificationFlows - Verification sessions
│   ├── OtpRecords - Secure OTP storage
│   └── FailedOtpAttempts - Security audit trail
├── Membership Domain (User Management)
│   ├── Memberships - User accounts
│   └── MembershipAttempts - Registration audit
└── Logging Domain (Observability)
    ├── LoginAttempts - Authentication audit
    └── EventLog - System events
```

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Model
1. **Rate Limiting Layer**
   - 30 verification flows/hour per phone
   - 5 OTP attempts per session
   - 5 login attempts per 5-minute window

2. **Progressive Security Layer**
   - Automatic session expiration
   - Progressive lockout mechanisms
   - Secure key encryption

3. **Audit Layer**
   - Comprehensive attempt logging
   - Security event tracking
   - Failed attempt analysis

## 📈 Performance Design

### Indexing Strategy
- **Primary Indexes**: Unique identification
- **Foreign Key Indexes**: Join optimization  
- **Filtered Indexes**: Active record queries
- **Composite Indexes**: Multi-column searches
- **Temporal Indexes**: Time-based queries

### Query Optimization
- **Inline Table Functions**: Better performance than scalar functions
- **Parameterized Procedures**: SQL injection prevention
- **Proper JOIN patterns**: Optimized data retrieval
- **Conditional logic**: Reduced resource usage
